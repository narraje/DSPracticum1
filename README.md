This is simply a collaboratory space for our project. 

Question 1: this is superflous and anyone who wants to upload an answer can if they want (we can just choose the best one)

Question 3: Tyler

Question 4: Nico

Question 5: Nico/Nikhil

Question 6: Nikhil

You can work on your designated question in whatever environment you'd like (google collab, jupyter notebook, etc), just download the file to your file system. Once downloaded to your file system go to the code page of the repository and click "add a file", then select the file you were working on and commit the file with whatever message you want to main. 

Ideally when commiting your question to main highlight the question it is and whether or not it is done.

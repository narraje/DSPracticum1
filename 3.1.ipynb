The analysis of air traffic across the three states (AZ, NV, CA) was conducted using various metrics, starting with total flight time. By evaluating air traffic based on total flight time rather than just the frequency of flights, we get a better understanding of how intensively the airspace and airport resources are used. States like California (CA) might show the highest total flight time due to the presence of several major airports handling long-haul flights, while Nevada (NV) may have fewer flights but longer durations, indicating its role in long-distance or international travel.
